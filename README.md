# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è Runs database in SQL

## üìù Description
This project focuses on analyzing my personal running data collected from sports watch during half-marathon training. Data is transformed into a SQL database consisting of two tables, which together can be used for detailed performance analysis.

This project includes **`data cleaning`**, **`database creation`** and **`exploratory analysis`** through SQL queries designed to provide insights into training progress, strategy and consistency. 

---

## üìä Data
The dataset contains detailed information on **32 running sessions** divided into three distinct run types. Each run is further broken down into segments, allowing for a more accurate and dynamic analysis. Data is divided into 2 tables:

- **`runs`** - provides basic information about each training session: date, time, distance and run type (*Easy run, Sprint series, Progressive run*)
- **`segments`** - contains detailed information about each segment within a run including segment type, **468 observations** (*Warmup, Slow run, Fast run, Run, Sprint, Rest, Cooldown*), segment lenght and performance statistics 

---

## üéØ Goal

The main goal of this project is to transform raw running data collected from a Garmin watch into a structured SQL database that enables detailed analysis. Table **`runs`** captures summary metrics of each workout, while table **`segments`** provides a detailed breakdown of each session into its individual components. This structure allows both macro (long-term progress) and micro (intra-session performance) analysis. Through this approach, it becomes possible to:
- **track progress** - evaluate improvement in pace, endurance and heart rate across training sessions and training segments, 
- **analyse training structure** - explore the distribution of run types and how training intensity evolved closed to race day,
- **assess consistency** - determine how systematically the entire training plan was executed and identify periods of high or low engagement.

## üöÄ Program Walk-through

### 1. First look into data
*`runs`* table

![image_alt](https://github.com/Piotr-Trybala/SQL_Runs_Data/blob/2ae4724b48aa742d0eed65e6c6b2977cef1319e6/Screenshots/runs.png)

*`segments`* table

---

### 2. Creating *`runs_data`* database

```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS runs_data;
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS runs_data
	CHARACTER SET 'utf8mb4' 
	COLLATE 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci';
SHOW DATABASES;
USE runs_data;
```
#### 2.1 Creating *`runs`* table
```sql
CREATE TABLE runs (
	run_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    run_date DATE NOT NULL,
    run_type ENUM('Sprint series', 'Easy run', 'Progressive run') NOT NULL,
    total_distance_km DECIMAL(5,2),
    total_time TIME
	);
```
Filling the data manually into the table.
```sql
INSERT INTO runs (run_date, run_type, total_distance_km, total_time)
VALUES 
	(STR_TO_DATE('26.06.2025', '%d.%m.%Y'), 'Sprint series', 5.400, '00:40:38'),
	(STR_TO_DATE('30.06.2025', '%d.%m.%Y'), 'Easy run', 6.370, '00:40:00'),
	...
	(STR_TO_DATE('12.10.2025', '%d.%m.%Y'), 'Easy run', 21.310, '01:57:09');
```
#### 2.2 Creating *`segments`* table
```sql
CREATE TABLE segments (
	segment_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    run_id INT,
    segment_number INT,
    segment_type ENUM('Cooldown', 'Fast run', 'Rest', 'Run', 'Slow run', 'Sprint', 'Warmup') NOT NULL,
    segment_distance DECIMAL(5,2),
    segment_time TIME,
    avg_pace TIME,
    avg_hr INT,
    max_he INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (run_id) REFERENCES runs(run_id)
	);
```
Filling the data into segments table using Table Data Import Wizard.

#### 2.3 Overview of created tables

*`runs`* table

![image_alt](https://github.com/Piotr-Trybala/SQL_Runs_Data/blob/63a8bd1e4d6bf7b994bb1208c366d147381a63eb/Screenshots/runs_table_overview.png)

*`segments`* table

![image_alt](https://github.com/Piotr-Trybala/SQL_Runs_Data/blob/63a8bd1e4d6bf7b994bb1208c366d147381a63eb/Screenshots/segments_table_overview.png)

Testing aggregate functions on time-based columns:

```sql
SELECT segment_type,AVG(avg_pace)																	
FROM segments
GROUP BY segment_type;
```
![image_alt](https://github.com/Piotr-Trybala/SQL_Runs_Data/blob/3d341610b5d2233c0b01f1059c0a37c5750556b9/Screenshots/type_time_avg.png)

There are few issues with data:
- **`total_time`** column - data type is *TIME* which can cause issues with aggregate functions (**`runs`** table)
- **`max_he`** column - typo in column name, max_he instead of max_hr (**`segments`** table)
- **`segment_time`** and **`avg_pace`** columns - wrong *TIME* format, seconds are taken as minutes and minutes as hours (**`segments`** table)
- **`segment_time`** and **`avg_pace`** columns - data type is *TIME* which can cause issues with aggregate functions (**`seconds`** table)

---

#### 2.4 Data cleaning 

##### Add column for total time in seconds (*`runs`* table) 

```sql
ALTER TABLE runs
	ADD COLUMN total_time_sec INT AFTER total_time;
UPDATE runs
SET 
	total_time_sec = TIME_TO_SEC(total_time);
```
---

##### Correct typo in column name (*`segments`* table)

```sql
ALTER TABLE segments 
	RENAME COLUMN max_he TO max_hr;
```

##### Correct wrong TIME format before converting into seconds (*`segments`* table)

The *`segment_time`* and *`avg_pace`* columns were imported in incorrect format - seconds were interpreted as minutes and minutes as hours. To fix this, we create new columns using the *`MAKETIME()`* function with *`HOUR`* and *`MINUTE`* as arguments. But first, we need to check for odd results in incorrectly imported data to make sure that functions are applicable.

```sql
SELECT MAX(segment_time), MAX(avg_pace)
FROM segments;
```
![image_alt](https://github.com/Piotr-Trybala/SQL_Runs_Data/blob/c4edf9b01cda3db862e7bf537f72ec7a2975267b/Screenshots/MAXs.png)

Since no value exceeds 60 hours, we can safely apply the transformation.

```sql
ALTER TABLE segments																				
	ADD COLUMN segment_time_fixed TIME AFTER segment_time,
    ADD COLUMN avg_pace_fixed TIME AFTER avg_pace;
```
Fill the new columns with corrected values using *`MAKETIME`* functions

```sql
UPDATE segments
SET
	segment_time_fixed = MAKETIME(0, HOUR(segment_time), MINUTE(segment_time)),
    avg_pace_fixed = MAKETIME(0, HOUR(avg_pace), MINUTE(avg_pace));
```

##### Convert TIME to seconds (INT)

```sql
ALTER TABLE segments																				
	ADD COLUMN segment_time_sec INT AFTER segment_time_fixed,
    ADD COLUMN avg_pace_sec INT AFTER avg_pace_fixed;
UPDATE segments
SET 
	segment_time_sec = TIME_TO_SEC(segment_time_fixed),
	avg_pace_sec = TIME_TO_SEC(avg_pace_fixed);
```

Testing aggregate functions on new columns:

```sql

	segment_type, 
    ROUND(AVG(avg_pace_sec),2) AS avg_pace_sec, 		
	SEC_TO_TIME(ROUND(AVG(avg_pace_sec))) AS avg_pace_formatted

GROUP BY segment_type;
```

    SEC_TO_TIME(
		ROUND((SELECT SUM(total_time_sec)/SUM(total_distance_km) 
		FROM runs))) AS overall_average_pace
FROM runs 
WHERE (total_time_sec/total_distance_km) < (
	SELECT SUM(total_time_sec)/SUM(total_distance_km)
    FROM runs
    )
;
